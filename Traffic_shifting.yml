#As said before, we have 3 versions of the application. If we want to route traffic from one version to other gradually, do as stated below:
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews
spec:
  hosts:
    - reviews
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v1
      weight: 50
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v3
      weight: 50
      
#once this file is run, traffic will be routed to v1 and after sometime refresh the page, the page will show v3
